This is my first attempt at creating a website from scratch :D

Using The Odin Project as a guide, I'm aiming to recreate the image they set up for the website to look like:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png" alt="The Odin Project 'website from scratch'">

Good luck to me, I guess 🤷‍♂️

Finished the Website! Here are my results:

<img width="1920" height="1584" alt="website" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d17baf9-99be-4c02-8838-bc63740d97cc" />
